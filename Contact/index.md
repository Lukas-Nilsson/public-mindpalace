## What I'm Open To

- **Collaborations** — Especially around philosophy, technology, and meaningful projects
- **Feedback** — On ideas, writing, or projects
- **Conversations** — With others exploring similar questions about humanity, technology, and meaning
- **Opportunities** — That align with building toward a more positive, thoughtful future

## Response Time

I read everything, but respond selectively. If your message connects to ongoing work or shared interests, you'll likely hear back.

*This site itself is a form of contact — a way to share thinking transparently and invite dialogue through public work.*
