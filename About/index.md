# About

I design and ship software with a focus on clarity, performance, and usefulness. My background spans web engineering, content systems, and product design.

---

## Now

- Building **[The Human Archives](Projects/the-human-archives.md)**
- Prototyping content pipelines from Markdown → web
- Improving web performance and accessibility on real projects

---

## Skills

- Frontend: TypeScript, React, Astro, Next.js
- Architecture: content systems, static builds, GitHub Pages pipelines
- UX: information architecture, typography, responsive systems
- Ops: GitHub Actions, submodules, deployment workflows

---

## Principles

- Clarity over cleverness
- Evidence before claims (measure, then decide)
- Ship in small slices; iterate visibly

---

## Selected work

- [The Human Archives](/projects/the-human-archives/) — product, design system, content pipeline
- [Personal Website](/projects/personal-website/) — Astro site with GitHub Pages + Obsidian sync
