# AI Coaching

Learn to understand, not just use, artificial intelligence.

---

## Focus

Corporate team upskilling: I work with existing teams to build AI capability. The goal is integration—not just tool training, but strategic thinking about where and how AI fits into workflows.

---

## Approach

I don't teach you the tools. You learn best by using them.

What I teach:
- How to approach the tools strategically
- How to enjoy using AI (reduces friction, increases adoption)
- Why it's valuable in your specific context
- How to think about AI within dynamic, changing environments

The difference: understanding vs. usage. When you understand the underlying principles, you adapt as tools evolve.

## Philosophy

**Meta-to-micro method:**
- Start with strategy: Where does AI fit? What problems does it solve?
- Move to practice: Specific prompts, workflows, integrations
- Build systems: How to make AI sustainable in your workflows

**Principles:**
- Conversational, practical approach (no jargon-for-jargon's sake)
- Evidence-based: Show results, measure improvement
- Security-aware: Understanding data privacy, compliance, confidential information

---

## My Background

- US degree in relevant field
- Real-world experience building AI-integrated systems
- Active practitioner: I use AI daily in product development and content systems

See my [other work](/projects/) for examples of AI-assisted development.

## For Corporate Teams

**What I offer:**
- Team workshops on AI strategy and integration
- One-on-one coaching for key team members
- Workflow audits: Where can AI add value safely?
- Security and compliance guidance

**Outcomes:**
- Teams that understand AI's role, not just its features
- Sustainable workflows that improve over time
- Reduced fear, increased adoption
- Clear ROI through measured improvements

## Get Started

[Book a session](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/appointments/schedules) to discuss your team's needs.

Start with a pilot session—we'll audit your current workflows, identify AI opportunities, and build a training plan tailored to your team.

**Note:** This is an evolving practice. I work with teams that want to grow with AI, not just adopt it reactively.
