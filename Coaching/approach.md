# Teaching Approach

---

## The Problem with Tool-First Training

Most AI training focuses on features: "Click here, use this prompt, try that tool." This creates dependency—when tools change (and they always do), knowledge becomes obsolete.

**Better approach:** Understand the underlying principles, then apply them to any tool.

## Meta-to-Micro Method

### Level 1: Strategy (Meta)

**Questions we address:**
- How do you use AI currently? What's working, what isn't?
- How could you use AI? (Not what tools exist, but what problems need solving)
- What needs to change in your workflows to maximize AI value?
- Why is this the only way forward? (Understanding inevitability and competitive advantage)

**Focus:** Systems thinking, not feature lists.

### Level 2: Practice (Micro)

**After strategy comes execution:**
- Specific prompting techniques
- Tool selection and comparison
- Workflow integration
- Quality control and iteration

**Focus:** Application, not memorization.

## Core Principles

### 1. You are the lever

AI amplifies your capability—but only if you know what you're amplifying. The tool doesn't think; you think, and AI accelerates.

### 2. Data is the AI's mind

- **Training data** = the model's foundational knowledge (like a limbic system)
- **Your data** = the context you provide (like a prefrontal cortex)
- **Accessibility** = all data can become accessible with the right architecture

Understanding data flows helps you use AI more effectively.

### 3. Dynamic context

AI exists in an extremely dynamic environment:
- Rapid rate of progression
- No advancement other than integration
- Improvement comes from learning how to use it better

Teaching static knowledge is pointless. Teaching adaptation is essential.

## Learning Philosophy

**What I can't teach:**
- Every tool's features (they change too fast)
- Perfect prompts (context-dependent)
- Universal workflows (team-dependent)

**What I can teach:**
- How to approach tools strategically
- How to think about problems AI can solve
- How to build systems that adapt
- How to enjoy the process (reduces resistance, increases adoption)

---

## Practical Structure

**Session format:**
1. **Audit:** How are you currently using AI? What are the gaps?
2. **Strategy:** Where does AI fit? What problems does it solve?
3. **Practice:** Hands-on application to your actual work
4. **Systems:** Build sustainable workflows, not one-off tricks
5. **Review:** Measure results, iterate

**Attitude:**
- Humility: I don't know everything, and that's fine
- Conversational: Learning happens through dialogue
- Performance-aware: Show, don't just tell

---

## Why This Works

When teams understand principles:
- They adapt as tools change
- They innovate new applications
- They reduce reliance on external training
- They build internal capability

Result: sustainable AI adoption that compounds over time.
