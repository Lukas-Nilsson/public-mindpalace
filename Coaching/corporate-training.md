# Corporate AI Training

Team upskilling programs for organizations that want to build internal AI capability.

---

## Program Overview

We come into existing corporate teams and upskill your employees. Focus is on integration—helping teams understand where and how AI fits into their workflows, not just learning tool features.

---

## What We Cover

### Strategic Integration
- Where AI adds value (and where it doesn't)
- Workflow analysis: identifying automation opportunities
- Change management: reducing resistance, increasing adoption
- ROI measurement: tracking time saved, quality improvements

### Technical Skills
- Prompting strategies (meta-level principles)
- Tool selection and comparison
- Workflow design (AI + human collaboration)
- Quality control and iteration loops

### Security & Compliance
- Data privacy considerations
- Confidential information handling
- Audit trails and documentation
- Risk assessment for AI use cases

---

## Typical Program Structure

### Phase 1: Assessment (1-2 sessions)
- Current state audit: How is AI used now?
- Workflow analysis: Where are the opportunities?
- Team readiness: What's the learning curve?
- Goals: What outcomes are you targeting?

### Phase 2: Training (4-8 sessions)
- Group workshops: Core concepts and strategy
- One-on-one coaching: Individual workflow integration
- Hands-on practice: Real work applications
- Feedback loops: Measure and iterate

### Phase 3: Systems (Ongoing)
- Documentation: Build internal playbooks
- Peer learning: Create internal knowledge sharing
- Continuous improvement: Regular check-ins and updates

- Competitive advantage (teams that understand AI outperform)

---

## Who This Is For

**Ideal clients:**
- Teams already using AI but hitting limits
- Teams ready to invest in capability building
- Organizations that value strategic thinking over quick fixes
- Companies that want sustainable, not reactive, AI adoption

**Not ideal for:**
- Teams wanting "AI in 60 minutes" quick fixes
- Organizations looking for one-size-fits-all training
- Companies that want tools, not understanding

---

## Investment

Training is customized to team size, goals, and timeline. Typical programs range from:
- **Pilot session:** Single session audit and roadmap
- **Short program:** 4-6 sessions for focused skill-building
- **Extended program:** 8+ sessions for comprehensive capability building

All programs include:
- Pre-session preparation materials
