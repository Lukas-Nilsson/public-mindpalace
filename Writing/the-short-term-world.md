# The Short‑Term World

We live inside systems that reward the fastest hit: clicks, likes, instant deliveries, same‑day results. These incentives tilt our attention toward the immediate, even when the long‑term is where compounding value lives.

Short‑term rewards are not new. What’s new is their density and convenience. When the “effort to reward” ratio collapses, attention shifts from slow rewards (skill, relationships, health) to fast ones (scrolling, sugar, outrage). Over time, this reshapes our sense of what is “worth it.”

## What changes when we chase fast rewards

- Satiation rises, satisfaction falls: the easier the hit, the less it means.
- Planning horizons shrink: we optimize for the next hour, not the next year.
- Signaling replaces substance: we perform progress instead of doing it.

None of this makes people bad. It makes the environment powerful. Design sets behavior.

## Practical reversals

- Make long‑term rewards visible: progress trackers, weekly reviews, public changelogs.
- Increase friction on fast rewards: remove apps from home screen, add site blockers, delay notifications.
- Tie effort to evidence: measure what you want to grow (miles run, pages written, PRs merged).
- Build with peers: accountability shifts incentives from “now” to “next.”

Long‑term thinking is not a mood. It’s a set of constraints that make the future more attractive than the feed.

## Bottom line

Short‑term systems are default. Long‑term systems are designed. Choose them on purpose.
