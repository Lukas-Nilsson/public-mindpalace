# Against Nihilism

Nihilism says: nothing matters. In practice, it just means nothing can be proven to matter upfront.

But we don’t live upfront—we live forward. Meaning emerges when actions have effects, when commitments change outcomes, when evidence accumulates.

A practical stance:

- Start small: pick a domain where feedback is clear (fitness, code, craft).
- Commit time: show up on a schedule; measure something you control.
- Watch compounding: results become reasons; reasons create meaning.

Meaning isn’t handed to you. It’s built—by turning intentions into evidence.
