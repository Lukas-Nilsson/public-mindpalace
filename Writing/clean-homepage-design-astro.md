# Designing a Clean Homepage in Astro

A homepage should be clear in 2 seconds. This one is minimal by design.

---

## Layout

- Left‑aligned name set on two lines (“Lukas / Nilsson”)
- Generous spacing; content breathes on all screens
- System font stack for speed and consistency

---

## Navigation

- Top menu mirrors site sections: About, Projects, Writing, Contact
- Mobile: collapses to a simple menu
- Active states and focus rings for accessibility

---

## Content Rules

- One sentence purpose
- Current focus (short “Now” section)
- Links to key pages

---

## Why It Works

- No dependencies beyond Astro + CSS
- Reads well without animation
- Easy to maintain; content drives structure

When the work evolves, the homepage updates—without redesigning the whole site.
