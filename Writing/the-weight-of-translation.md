# The Weight of Translation

You think faster when you don’t have to explain yourself. You understand deeper when you do.

Translation slows you down. It forces precision: what do I actually mean? where is the evidence? what’s assumption vs. fact? The friction isn’t a bug. It’s the test.

A simple rule:

- If I can’t say it clearly, I don’t understand it enough.
- If I can say it clearly, I’ll understand it more once I do.

Clarity has a cost. Pay it upfront; collect the compound interest later.
